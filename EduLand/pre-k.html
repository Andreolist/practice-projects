            <h2>How to help your little one learn to count?</h2>
            <br>
            <strong>Number Recognition:</strong>
            <br>
            Start by helping children recognize the symbols that represent the numbers 1, 2, and 3. These are the basic building blocks of counting. You can use visual aids like flashcards or written numbers to familiarize them with each numeral.
            <br><br>
            <div class="images">
              <h1>1</h1>
              <h1>2</h1>
              <h1>3</h1>
            </div>
            <br>
            <strong>Sequence Understanding:</strong>
            <br>
            Teach children the order in which numbers come. The sequence goes: 1, 2, 3. Emphasize that each number comes after the one before it. Reinforce this concept through repetition and daily activities.
            <br><br>
            <div class="images">
              <h1>1</h1>
              <h1>&rarr;</h1>
              <h1>2</h1>
              <h1>&rarr;</h1>
              <h1>3</h1>
            </div>
            <br>
            <strong>Counting Objects:</strong>
            <br>
            Engage children in counting sets of objects. For example, if there are three apples, have them count each one: "One apple, two apples, three apples." This hands-on approach helps in grasping the concept of counting as a tool for quantifying.

              <img src="./assets/img/26966.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <br>
            <strong>Counting Aloud:</strong>
            <br>
            Encourage children to count out loud. Start by counting from 1 to 3 with them. Use simple and repetitive phrases like "one, two, three." This helps in both reinforcing the sequence and associating the count with specific quantities.
            <br><br>

            <br>
            <strong>Repetition and Practice:</strong>
            <br>
            Repetition is crucial for learning. Practice counting to three regularly during everyday activities, like counting steps, counting toys, or counting bites during a meal. The more children practice, the more confident they become in their counting abilities.

            <br>
            <strong>Playful Learning:</strong>
            <br>
            Infuse a sense of playfulness into counting activities. Use games, songs, and interactive play to make the learning experience enjoyable. Play hide-and-seek and count to three before revealing a hidden object or person.

            <strong>Remember to keep the learning process positive, encouraging, and age-appropriate. Children often learn best through hands-on experiences and play, so make counting to three a fun and engaging activity.</strong></p>

            <strong>Counting Objects:</strong>
            <br>
            Engage children in counting sets of objects. For example, if there are three apples, have them count each one: "One apple, two apples, three apples." This hands-on approach helps in grasping the concept of counting as a tool for quantifying.

            <strong>Counting Aloud:</strong>
            <br>
            Encourage children to count out loud. Start by counting from 1 to 3 with them. Use simple and repetitive phrases like "one, two, three." This helps in both reinforcing the sequence and associating the count with specific quantities.

            <strong>Repetition and Practice:</strong>
            <br>
            Repetition is crucial for learning. Practice counting to three regularly during everyday activities, like counting steps, counting toys, or counting bites during a meal. The more children practice, the more confident they become in their counting abilities.

            <br>
            Infuse a sense of playfulness into counting activities. Use games, songs, and interactive play to make the learning experience enjoyable. Play hide-and-seek and count to three before revealing a hidden object or person.

              <strong>Number Recognition:</strong>
              <br>
              Start by helping children recognize the symbols that represent the numbers 1, 2, and 3. These are the basic building blocks of counting. You can use visual aids like flashcards or written numbers to familiarize them with each numeral.

            <strong>Number Recognition:</strong>
            <br>
            Start by helping children recognize the symbols that represent the numbers 1, 2, and 3. These are the basic building blocks of counting. You can use visual aids like flashcards or written numbers to familiarize them with each numeral.
            <br><br>
            <div class="images">
              <h1>1</h1>
              <h1>2</h1>
              <h1>3</h1>
            </div>
            <br>
            <strong>Sequence Understanding:</strong>
            <br>
            Teach children the order in which numbers come. The sequence goes: 1, 2, 3. Emphasize that each number comes after the one before it. Reinforce this concept through repetition and daily activities.
            <br><br>
            <div class="images">
              <h1>1</h1>
              <h1>&rarr;</h1>
              <h1>2</h1>
              <h1>&rarr;</h1>
              <h1>3</h1>
            </div>
            <br>
            <strong>Counting Objects:</strong>
            <br>
            Engage children in counting sets of objects. For example, if there are three apples, have them count each one: "One apple, two apples, three apples." This hands-on approach helps in grasping the concept of counting as a tool for quantifying.

            </div>
            <br>
            <strong>Counting Aloud:</strong>
            <br>
            Encourage children to count out loud. Start by counting from 1 to 3 with them. Use simple and repetitive phrases like "one, two, three." This helps in both reinforcing the sequence and associating the count with specific quantities.
            <br><br>
            <div class="images">
              <img src="./assets/img/w8gd_4ji7_220329.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <br>
            <strong>Repetition and Practice:</strong>
            <br>
            Repetition is crucial for learning. Practice counting to three regularly during everyday activities, like counting steps, counting toys, or counting bites during a meal. The more children practice, the more confident they become in their counting abilities.

            </div> 
            <br>
            <strong>Playful Learning:</strong>
            <br>
            Infuse a sense of playfulness into counting activities. Use games, songs, and interactive play to make the learning experience enjoyable. Play hide-and-seek and count to three before revealing a hidden object or person.
            <br><br>
            <div class="images">
              <img src="./assets/img/a644_8ume_220311.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <br>
            
            <strong>Remember to keep the learning process positive, encouraging, and age-appropriate. Children often learn best through hands-on experiences and play, so make counting to three a fun and engaging activity.</strong>
